# jiu-jitsu-auto-scoring
*This Readme is a **WIP***
## Introduction

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that emphasizes grappling, ground fighting, and submission techniques, with most of the action occurring on the ground. The objective is to control or neutralize an opponent by taking them to the ground and applying techniques to secure a submission. In this project, we aim to develop an automatic match scoring algorithm for BJJ matches, leveraging machine learning to analyze and score bouts. This builds on existing research, incorporating insights from previous academic work to enhance accuracy and applicability.
